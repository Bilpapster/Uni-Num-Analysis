# numerical-analysis-algorithms-in-Octave

<p>In this repository you can find code solutions to problems related to the field of Numerical Analysis. Code development was held alongside with the course "Numerical Analysis", that the author attendeed, during their third semester of studies in the School of Informatics, AUTh. The repository contains code for the two assignents of the course.
</p>

# First Assignment

<p>The first assignment covers the following fields of Numerical Analysis:
<ul>
  <li>Root Finding for non-linear functions
    <ul>
      <li>bisection method</li>
      <li>Newton-Raphson method</li>
      <li>secant method</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Solving linear systems of equations
    <ul>
      <li>Gaussian Elimination, through PA = LU factorization</li>
      <li>Cholesky Decomposition</li>
      <li>Gauss-Seidel method</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Eigenanalysis and its application in Google Page-Rank
     <ul>
      <li>the power method of calculating eigenvalues</li>
      <li>Analysis on the Google's Page Rank algorithm</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p> The code files for the first assignment were originally developed in December 2020, in GNU Octave programming language. Apart from source code files, the first assignment directory contains a report, that was handed complementary. The report covers in theory the reasoning behind the code solutions, as well as serves as code documentation.</p>

# Second Assignment

<p>The second assignment covers the following fields of Numerical Analysis:
<ul>
  <li> Interpolation, and in particular
    <ul>
      <li>polynomial interpolation/li>
      <li>(natural) cubic splines</li>
      <li>least squares</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Quadrature, and in particular
    <ul>
      <li>the Trapezoid rule</li>
      <li>the Simpson's rule</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An application of interpolation (least squares) in data fitting and stock forecast</li>
</ul>

<p> The code files for the second assignment were originally developed in January 2021, in GNU Octave programming language. Apart from source code files, the second assignment directory contains a report, that was handed complementary. The report covers in theory the reasoning behind the code solutions, as well as serves as code documentation.</p>
