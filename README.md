# numerical-analysis-algorithms-in-Octave

<p>In this repository you can find code solutions to problems related to the field of Numerical Analysis. Code development was held alongside with the course "Numerical Analysis", that the author attendeed, during their third semester of studies in the School of Informatics, AUTh. 
</p>

<p>The repository contains source code for the following fields of Numerical Analysis:
<ul>
  <li>Root Finding for non-linear functions
    <ul>
      <li>bisection method</li>
      <li>Newton-Raphson method</li>
      <li>secant method</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Solving linear systems of equations
    <ul>
      <li>Gaussian Elimination, through PA = LU factorization</li>
      <li>Cholesky Decomposition</li>
      <li>Gauss-Seidel method</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Eigenanalysis and its application in Google Page-Rank
     <ul>
      <li>the power method of calculating eigenvalues</li>
      <li>Analysis on the Google's Page Rank algorithm</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>The codes contained in this repository serve as code solutions for the first assignment in the course. They were originally developed in December 2020, in GNU Octave programming language. Apart from source code files, the repository contains a report, that waas handed complementary. The report covers in theory the reasoning behind the code solutions, as well as serves as code documentation.</p>
